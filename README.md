## Course Roadmap and Philosophy
The quickest, most effective way to learn any language is based on these three principles. We'll see how they specifically apply to learning Japanese.

## Language Learning Linchpins
1. **Start learning the irreducibles as soon as possible.** For Japanese, that means vocabulary and kanji.
2. **Consume a lot of native material.** Read books and articles and manga; watch movies and anime; listen to podcasts and music.
3. **Make it social.**

Let's get into what each of these means.

## Irreducible Components

First, all languages have a number of what I'm going to call **irreducible components**, things you have to learn that you can't gimmick yourself out of. There are no shortcuts for learning these things (which doesn't necessarily mean they have to always be dull, hard work). Irreducible components exist in contrast to something that you could learn at the more conceptual level, the type of content we usually think of as being on a math or a chemistry test, for example. These kinds of tests are full of problems that target your ability to apply concepts rather than check your recall on rote memorization. (Hopefully.) You learn how to multiply numbers, and then you apply that knowledge in novel ways on the test, i.e., you multiply two numbers that you've never multiplied before. Compare that with learning vocabulary. There is no concept under the word φυχή that tells you what that word means. That word, *psyche*, means "life" in ancient Greek. The word itself is the most fundamental piece of knowledge you need to understand it. There is no word multiplication you can do to figure out what that word means. You know it or you don't. (With some big caveats.)

Let's talk briefly about those caveats because it's not all sheer, rote memorization. The more you learn a language, the more tricks you accumulate to help you out, at least to some degree. If you know that adding "-(e)r" to the end of a verb in English is one pattern for coming up with nouns for people who do those things professionally or seriously or frequently, then you can start to guess what a "baker" is if you know the word "bake". You can start to guess what a "writer" is if you know the word "write". I'm told that in the original Hebrew, God's confrontation with Cain is [quite sassy](https://mobile.twitter.com/JessiSheron/status/1503904577380405255). It involves the expression "my brother's keeper", which then turned into a whole book and movie inspired by the same line, which means... you get it.

You've probably also accumulated some cultural knowledge that helps out too. Many people, seeing the word romanized as *psyche*, probably started to have some ideas about the general direction that word was going to take, considering we have "psyche" and "psychology" and "psychic" in everyday use in English.

Still, these caveats are of relatively tiny help in the vast wilderness of learning vocabulary, which is itself only one example of an irreducible component of languages. For the most part, you have to learn hundreds or thousands of these things to start feeling comfortable in your new language, so it pays to start early.

Vocabulary is arguably the most fundamental of these irreducible components, no matter the language you're learning. Sure, if you're learning a language that's relatively similar to one you already know—say, for example, an English speaker learning French or Spanish—the "height", so to speak, of this irreducible component will be lower than it would be for learning a very different language—c.f., that same English speaker learning Mandarin—but importantly, vocabulary, relatively familiar or relatively unfamiliar, is an irreducible component. No matter what, you will still have to spend many *many* hours learning vocabulary.

For most (all?) languages, verbal conjugation is another irreducible. It will take many *many* hours of practice to be able to quickly identify and produce conjugations. Indeed, for many languages, the conjugation (or case) system is one of the biggest hurdles to entry. For example, Latin has a bad reputation for its conjugation system. I'm a huge fan of the Dowling method for learning Latin and Latin-descended languages. These languages have rather more complex and irregular systems of conjugation (see image below), and the Dowling method has you start learning the entirety of the verbal conjugation system almost from day one.

![latin conjugation](images/latin_conjugations.png)

This is the conjugation for 1 major type of verb in Latin. There are 4 major types, each with a layout as complex as the above, and worse still there are plenty of verbs with irregular conjugations that deviate a little (or a lot) from one of the four standard conjugations. For Japanese, verb (and noun and adjective) conjugation is definitely an irreducible component, and not a trivial one either, but I'm not recommending you start learning all Japanese conjugations from the beginning of your studies. There are more pressing concerns.

Such as kanji. Kanji is the much more pressing concern. For the most part, written Japanese uses kanji for everything with a little bit of hiragana thrown in for conjugation and other grammatical purposes. You need to learn about 1,000 kanji to be able to start telling your head from your ass in a text, and you need about 2,000 kanji to start getting the nuances.

If that weren't reason enough to learn kanji (there's still a camp of people who think they don't need to learn kanji?), even listening comprehension is made much, much easier by knowing kanji. I remember my first semester of study abroad in Tokyo, my Japanese language professor said (translating), "Japanese is full of homonyms. How do Japanese people tell the difference between *kanji* (感じ) and *kanji* (漢字)? Context, and something that's happening in their heads: *kanji*." Long story short, there's a reason that Japanese has kept using kanji while Korea, another language with a zillion Chinese-origin words, was able to more or less easily drop them. Take a look at this chart ([source](https://www.quora.com/When-Koreans-can-abandon-Chinese-characters-why-cant-the-Japanese)).

![kanji!!!](images/kanji_are_important.jpeg)

The 1st column on the left shows the original Chinese word with characters, and the 2nd and 3rd columns show its modern pronunciation in Mandarin and Cantonese, respectively. The 4th column shows the modern Korean pronunciation. They used to use kanji (called hanja), but now they mostly use an alphabet (hangeul). The second to last column is the ancient Japanese pronunciation and the last column is the modern Japanese pronunciation.

What are we noticing?

That 45 words, mostly having all different pronunciations in modern Mandarin, Cantonese, and Korean each, have a single pronunciation in modern Japanese, *koushou*. Some of these words are archaic, but plenty of them are not. This isn't even all the words that are pronounced *koushou* in modern Japanese. So when you hear the word *koushou*, how do you figure out which of these words it is? Context and kanji. Sure, maybe you just memorize 45+ different possible meanings for the sound *koushou*, but having kanji in your head helps a ton.

Plus, remember those caveats from earlier? Those little helper patterns that make learning new words easier? Kanji is one of those caveats for Japanese. When you learn kanji, you (kind of) start to get free words. Each kanji has one or at most a few core meanings, and two or at most a few core readings. When you combine one kanji with another, you start to get new, somewhat predictable meanings. 無, *mu*, means "no, none, nothing" and 口, *kuchi*, means mouth. Not surprisingly, 無口, *mukuchi*, means "taciturn, reticient, quiet".

I hope you're sufficiently motivated. If you're used to life inside of an alphabet, kanji can seem tedious and archaic, but I pinky promise, in the long run they help with both listening and reading comprehension. Plus, they're just beautiful, aren't they?


## How to apply it

1. **Learn hiragana**. All of them. Virtual Anki cards or physical flash cards or writing the full chart from memory. Take a week or two or even a month or five to learn them.
2. **Learn katakana**. All of them. Timeframe and methodology as above.
3. **Start learning kanji**. As soon as possible. Continue until (and probably after) you die. You exist to learn kanji. This is your life now. When you know them all, no you don't. Welcome to the enclave. You can use
    - physical flash cards, or
    - virtual flashcards like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), or
    - [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/), my personal favorite (I'm not being paid to say that), or one of its (free) derivatives, or
    - even something like [Remembering the Kanji](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11377627-remembering-the-kanji-1) to get yourself started remembering meanings but not pronunciations

Irreducible components, namely vocab and kanji, can be massive barriers to comfortably understanding and producing material in the target language, so start early, because the benefits compound continuously (I have no data to back this, merely a sincere and powerful feeling behind my sternum).

So start, as close to day one as possible. Be flexible, but be relentless. Just a few, or 10, or 20 new vocabulary words a day. Start with a few hundred of the most common words. When you find a song, anime, manga, book you like, pick out vocab, even a single new word, and throw it on your pile of flashcards.

## Extensive Consumption

Next, you need to **consume lots of native material**. Lots. As soon as you can. Even if a lot of it doesn't make sense. Importantly, this is of much greater importance than language production (though still a necessary component). The credit for this idea goes entirely to Kato Lomb, who has written one of the best books ever on language learning (and indeed one of the best books ever, period), [*Polyglot: How I Learn Languages*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6290281). For credit, merely I can vouch for its effectiveness.
